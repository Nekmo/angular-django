**Angular Django** is a framework to work in *Angular* as in *Django*. Use the Django classes in Angular to build
**forms** and **data** grids in minutes. [A demo is available on the website](https://angular-django.nekmo.org/).

Angular-django consists of **two packages**: a package for *Angular* and an optional package for *Django*. To install
the Angular package:

```shell
$ npm i angular-django
```
    

To install the Django package:

```shell
$ pip install -U angular-django
```

Full instructions are available [on the website](https://angular-django.nekmo.org/installation>).
